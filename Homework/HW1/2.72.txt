A.

Since the sizeof operator returns a value of type size_t, which is unsigned.
When a signed number operates with an unsigned number, the result will be caste
d to unsigned.
Therefore, in the if conditional statement ( maxbytes - sizeof(val) >=0), it
will always be true since the result is unsigned and the value is always non-
negative.

B.

We can rewrite the condition test as:

maxbytes >= 0 && maxbytes >= sizeof(val)
